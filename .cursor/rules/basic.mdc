Always use the rules in [Index.jsx](mdc:frontend/src/components/admin/States/Index.jsx) . Okay like the pagination the requests, how I get them from the server and the way how I set up dialogues translations. You need to add translation for each word which you add into page in [english.js](mdc:frontend/src/utils/translations/english.js) and in [arabic.js](mdc:frontend/src/utils/translations/arabic.js) . And always remove the dummy data which I have used to showcase it showcase the page to the admins, remove that dummy data and use real data from the server. Make the request to do everything according to the conventions.


always make the date fields so that if I click everywhere on the input it needs to open the calender to select the data currently it's wokring when I click on the small calender Icon.
