Please keep everything minial and as easy and simple as possible I need clean and clear code always I do not want messy code and new fancy coding rules ot be implemented here as simple as possible you understand.

Always use the rules in [Index.jsx](mdc:frontend/src/components/admin/ExpenesCategory/Index.jsx) . Okay like the pagination the requests, how I get them from the server and the way how I set up dialogues translations. You need to add translation for each word which you add into page in [english.js](mdc:frontend/src/utils/translations/english.js) and in [arabic.js](mdc:frontend/src/utils/translations/arabic.js) . then after this create an a route if dones't exists in [adminRoutes.jsx](mdc:frontend/src/router/adminRoutes.jsx) and after that create a link in [app-sidebar.jsx](mdc:frontend/src/components/admin/Layouts/Includes/app-sidebar.jsx) with unique Icon.
And always remove the dummy data which I have used to showcase it showcase the page to the admins, remove that dummy data and use real data from the server. Make the request to do everything according to the conventions.

if a page has a dialog please create it in a seperate file don't create a lot of clutter in the same file. it reduces the readability

always make the date fields so that if I click everywhere on the input it needs to open the calender to select the data currently it's wokring when I click on the small calender Icon.

use the select as it's custom and made for project [Select.jsx](mdc:frontend/src/components/misc/Select.jsx).

and for status colors. make changes in the variants of [badge.jsx](mdc:frontend/src/components/ui/badge.jsx)

When I talk about flow it means that I need the user story how it's going to work like first the user will click on this. Then front end will call the back end and this function will work and this function will return this data. This model will be used by this relationship like this. I need a complete story like slow means to me like the complete thing. How it's going to work, how the things are going to work. You know I do not need code. I just need the story in simple English words and I need several paragraphs. You know I do not need headings and these things. I just need a story which will have names of the pages and all files and their functions and it will tell me like what they are doing. please do not give me code at all just me the idea to englighten me.
